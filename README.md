# MAPS-Bootstrap

R project for bootstrapping MAPS adult abundance trend models using SDSU TIDE computational core facility

NOTE: adulttrends_boot.rds is too large (~ 200MB). Download from google drive folder and place in the base directory.

NOTE2: This was a first pass at using the cluster (which worked great in the end!), so some of the steps can be streamlined / combined in the future.
